# open-world-godot


- PCG Terrain (Procedurally Generated Terrain) - Simple perlin noise with incrementing random seed (so with X seed the terrain will "always" be the same (not in this case, later on yes)
- Basic animation state machine using mixamo animations.
- VRM 0.0 support added (This test build has 2 VRoid base characters)
- Fully animated grass using ghshader (glsl vertex + fragment shader equivalent)
